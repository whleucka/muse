### Getting Started
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/whleucka/muse.git`
- Follow the setup instructions in the README for dependencies and configuration *WIP*
    - Install composer dependencies

        ```bash
        composer install
        ```

    - Copy the example .env and update your database credentials

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

    - Generate a secure application key, add this to your .env under APP_KEY

        ```bash
        ./bin/console generate-key
        ```

    - Run the database migrations

        ```bash
        ./bin/console migrate-fresh
        ```

    - Run the muse cli to scan your music collection. This could take a while, depending on how many files require id3 tag analysis.

        ```bash
        ./bin/console music-scan /path/to/music
        ```

    - Create a storage directory and give the proper permissions. Create a sym link in the public directory

        ```bash
        mkdir ./storage
        chown -R www-data:www-data storage
        cd public && ln -s ../storage
        ```

    - Access your music library, podcasts, or HD radio through the web interface!
